**Context:** Teachers spend a lot of time in class updating records which are essential for managing large scale schooling operations in the country comprising of 
23 crore students. Technology has made deep inroads into the hands of teachers with most of them having access to basic smart phone at the minimum. 
Teachers and administration staff in schools routinely have to update mid-day meal consumption data, attendance, and other relevant information including distribution 
of uniforms etc. Problem Statement: Could AI/ML based OCR/OMR technology be used to help automate attendance and other school data records Description: 
Use Computer vision, OCR/OMR to solve for digitizing attendence, tracking mid-day meal data and other similar book keeping activities leveraging basic digital devices 
available to the teacher. Leveraging NDEAR OCR/OMR building block, NDEAR Language translation block; Improvising if required leveraging the relevant NDEAR building 
blocks such as Saral, NDEAR Registries. Establish national/state reference dashboard to aggregate data leveraging the NDEAR building blocks.
